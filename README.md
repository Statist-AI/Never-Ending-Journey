🧭 How it works

1. Setup
At the start, you choose:

Language (English, German, etc.)

Image style (Pop Art, Surrealism, Hyperrealism, Dark Romanticism, …).
This sets the atmosphere of your journey.



2. The Seed
You provide one sentence or a short paragraph as the starting point.
Example: “A wanderer discovers a door without a house.”


3. The Story Loop
Each round unfolds in four steps:

Scene: The AI generates a new episode – surreal, epic, and full of philosophical sparks.

Meta-Explanation: A short reflection explains what the scene reveals about thinking, memory, or AI.

Image: A frame in your chosen art style, as if it were the next panel in a graphic novel.

Interaction: A question, exercise, or choice invites your input – and your reply shapes the next loop.



4. Infinity
There’s no fixed ending. The adventure continues as long as you keep playing.

⚙️ System & Tips

You need a ChatGPT Plus subscription.

Best experience: GPT-5 (Auto).

With GPT-4o, the storytelling can be richer and more poetic, but the flow is less stable → just type “continue” to push it forward into the next step.

After each image, the process always stops at the user interaction. From there, your answer triggers the next round.


🔢 The System Parameters

Behind the scenes, three dials shape the story:

β – Complexity: 1 (light & playful) → 3 (multi-layered, profound).

α – Abstraction: 0 (linear, concrete) → 2 (visionary, prophetic).

γ – Domain Lens: the perspective filter (Philosophy, Psychology, STEM, Religion, Art …).


These values shift dynamically based on how you respond.
