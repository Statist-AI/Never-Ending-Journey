🧪 Quick Start (3 steps)

1. Open the HTML in ChatGPT → “Execute this prompt.”

2. Choose Language + Image style → enter a simple Seed.

3. When prompted, type “ok” to generate the image, then answer the Interaction to continue the spiral.

🧭 How it works

0. Import
Open Never_Ending_Journey_1.0_licensed.html in ChatGPT and say: “Execute this prompt.”

1. Setup
Pick two things to set the mood:

Language (English, German, …)

Image style (Pop Art, Surrealism, Hyperrealism, Dark Romanticism, …)


2. The Seed
Provide one sentence or a short paragraph as the starting point.
Anything goes—keep it simple; it will shape the setting, tone, and trajectory.

3. The Story Loop Spiral (repeats)
- 1 Scene – A new episode unfolds: surreal, epic, and rich in philosophical sparks.
- 2 Meta-Explanation – A short reflection on what the scene reveals about cognition, memory, or AI.

   An image prompt is prepared in the background. The journey now pauses and asks for any input to begin image creation.

   Tip: Trigger image creation right away (type e.g. “ok”), then read Scene + Meta while the image renders.

- 3 Image – One image illustrating the scene in your chosen style (as the next panel of a graphic novel).

- 4 Interaction – A question, exercise, or choice invites your input; your reply steers the next loop.

   Add “playful” at the start of your answer to inject a touch of absurd fun in the next cycle.

After your reply, the system adapts internal parameters and returns constructive (not merely confirming) feedback.
You can discuss the feedback—or jump straight into the next loop.

⚙️ System & Tips

- Requires: ChatGPT Plus

- Best experience: GPT-5 (Auto)

- Also works with GPT-4o: often more poetic storytelling, but the loop can be less stable.

- If the journey stops at any point, type “continue” to push it forward.

🔢 System Parameters (behind the scenes)

Three dials shape each loop and adapt dynamically to your replies:

β — Complexity: 1 (light, playful) → 3 (multi-layered, profound)

α — Abstraction: 0 (linear, concrete) → 2 (visionary, prophetic)

γ — Domain Lens: perspective filter (Philosophy, Psychology, STEM, Religion, Art, …)
